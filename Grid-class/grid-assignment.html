            <h1>‘Appu is designed to be a personalised tutor’: How this Google-backed AI tool is reshaping education
            </h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence is on its way to reshape early childhood education in India, which is on the
                threshold of transformation. Delhi-based non-profit organisation Rocket Learning recently launched Appu,
                a new AI-powered learning tool that has been designed to support children between the ages of three and
                six. Appu, developed in collaboration with Google.org, uses generative AI to offer personalised and
                conversational learning experiences. With AI being increasingly integrated into everyday learning, the
                organisation aims to fill the gaps in early education, especially among those from underserved
                communities.</p>
            <p>Rocket Learning has been working extensively with Anganwadi centres–the government-run daycare and early
                learning centres–to enhance school readiness and IQ scores among young children. Sunil shared that the
                organisation reaches around 3.2 million children across 10 states in India, working closely with both
                caregivers and government stakeholders.</p>

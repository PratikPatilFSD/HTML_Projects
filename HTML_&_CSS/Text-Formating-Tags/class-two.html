    <h2>My top movies of all time</h2>
    <h4>1.Sholay</h4>
    <img src="./assets/images/sholay.jpg" width="100"/>
    <p>This cult masala western sees escaped convicts Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Bachchan) defend a village terrorised
        by bandits led by the maniacal Gabbar Singh (Khan). ‘Sholay’ has it all – epic dishum-dishum fight scenes,
        bromance, humour, memorable songs, plot twists, thrilling dance sequences and sparkling performances. The
        haunting score and Bollywood’s baddest villain are the icing on a rollicking, all-action cake.</p>

    <h4>2.Mother India</h4>
    <img src="./assets/images/motherindia.jpg" width="100"/>
    <p>The first Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign-Language Film at the Oscars, this is a heartbreaking story
        of the complexities of rural farming in newly independent India and the exploitation of farmers by their feudal
        landlords. It follows the hardships faced by Radha (Nargis), a village mother of three sons who is abandoned by
        her husband and forced to toil the paddy fields to survive.</p>

    <h4>3.Guide</h4>
    <img src="./assets/images/Guide.jpg" width="100"/>
    <p>Director Vijay Anand adapts RK Narayan’s English-language novel into a sprawling drama. ‘Guide’ tells of a man,
        Raju, who transforms from a tour guide in his youth into a great holy man later in life. The film is considered
        ahead of its time for showing its protagonists, Raju (Anand) and Rosie (Rehman), having an extra-marital affair,
        and also for presenting its lead character as an unscrupulous scumbag. Both were deeply unusual in a Hindi film
        of the time.</p>

    <h3>Homogeneous solution</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Homogeneous solutions are solutions with uniform composition and properties throughout the solution. For example
        a cup of coffee, perfume, cough syrup, a solution of salt or sugar in water, etc. </p>

    <h3>Heterogeneous solution</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Heterogeneous solutions are solutions with non-uniform composition and properties throughout the solution. A
        solution of oil and water, water and chalk powder and solution of water and sand, etc.</p>

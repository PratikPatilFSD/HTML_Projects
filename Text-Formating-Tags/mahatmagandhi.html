    <b><u>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</u></b> (2<sup>nd</sup> October 1869 – 30<sup>th</sup> January 1948) was an Indian
    lawyer,
    anti-colonial nationalist,
    and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence
    from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific
    <strong>Mahātmā</strong> (from
    Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in <b>South Africa</b> in 1914, is now used
    throughout
    the world.

    As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as <q>restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about.
        One
        of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears</q>. The Indian classics, especially the stories of
    <b><mark>Shravana</mark></b> and
    king <b><mark>Harishchandra</mark></b>, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi
    states that they
    left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: <q>It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to
        myself times without number</q>. Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is
    traceable
    to these epic characters

    In his 1927 <i>An Autobiography</i>, Vol. I, Gandhi wrote:

<blockquote><q>The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought
        it was quite
        improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of
        the
        objects of the society</q></blockquote>

    Indians widely describe Gandhi as the <b><mark>Father of the Nation</mark></b>. Origin of this title is
    traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6<sup>th</sup> July 1944 by <b>Subhash Chandra Bose</b> where Bose addressed
    Gandhi as <q>The Father of the Nation</q>.On 28<sup>th</sup> April 1947, <b>Sarojini Naidu</b> during a conference also referred Gandhi
    as "Father of the Nation". He is also <s>conferred</s> the title <q>Bapu</q>.

<hr />
<p>
    <b>Shivaji I </b>(Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale c. 19<sup>th</sup> February 1630 – 3<sup>rd</sup> April
    1680) was an Indian ruler and a member of the <b>Bhonsle dynasty</b>.Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom
    from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the <b>Maratha Confederacy</b> . Shivaji I was the founder
    of the
    <b>Maratha Empire</b> which later become the Maratha Confederacy.

</p>
<br />
<p>
    Shivaji belonged to a <strong>Maratha</strong> family of the <strong>Bhonsle</strong> clan.Shivaji's father,
    <b>Shahaji Bhonsle</b>, was a Maratha
    general who served the <b><u>Deccan Sultanates</u></b>. His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of
    Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of <b>Devagiri</b>. His paternal
    grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of <mark>Ahmadnagar Sultanate</mark>, and was awarded the
    epithet of
    <b><q>Raja</q></b>. He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He
    was
    also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (c. 1590)
</p>
<br />
<p>
    At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: <b>Bijapur,
        Ahmednagar,Golkonda,</b>
    and the <b>Mughal Empire</b>. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the <mark>Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshahi of Bijapur and the Mughals</mark>
    , but always kept his <i>jagir</i> (fiefdom) at <b>Pune</b> and his small army
</p>
<br />
<p>
    In the <strong>Treaty of Purandar</strong>, signed by Shivaji and Jai Singh on 11<sup>th</sup> June 1665, Shivaji
    agreed to give up 23 of his
    forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay compensation of 400,000 gold <strong><mark>hun</mark></strong> to
    the Mughals. Shivaji agreed to become
    a vassal of the Mughal empire, and to send his son Sambhaji, along with 5,000 horsemen, to fight for the Mughals in
    the Deccan, as a <u>mansabdar</u>.

<p>
    Noting that Shivaji had stemmed the spread of the neighbouring Muslim states, his contemporary, the poet <b>Kavi Bhushan</b>
     stated:

    <blockquote><q>Had not there been Shivaji, Kashi would have lost its culture, Mathura would have been turned into a mosque and all
        would have been circumcised.</q></blockquote>

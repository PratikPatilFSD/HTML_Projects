    <h1>State of matter</h1>
    <hr />
    <br />
    <p>In physics, a state of matter is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist. Four states of matter are
        observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such
        as liquid crystal, and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as Bose–Einstein condensates and
        Fermionic condensates (in extreme cold), neutron-degenerate matter (in extreme density), and quark–gluon plasma
        (at extremely high energy).
    <h2>Four classical states</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Solid</h3>
    <p>In a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together. The forces between
        particles are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a
        stable, definite shape, and a definite volume. Solids can only change their shape by an outside force, as when
        broken or cut.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Liquid</h3>
    <p>A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly)
        constant volume independent of pressure. The volume is definite if the temperature and pressure are constant.
        When a solid is heated above its melting point, it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the
        triple point of the substance.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Gas</h3>
    <p>In a gas, the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero
        for an ideal gas), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular
        size. A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined. A liquid
        may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point, or else by reducing the pressure
        at constant temperature.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Plasma</h3>
    <p>A gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, either from a huge voltage difference between two
        points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures. Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons
        to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons.</p>
